# Maze Generator and Solver

This is a simple maze generator that uses backtracking to carve passages on a grid. 

The solver uses an A* pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest distance from start to finish.

This was made using [p5js](https://p5js.org) and was inspired by [The BuckBlog](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking)'s recursive backtracking blog post.
